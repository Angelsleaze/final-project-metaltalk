#Intro

This is my first ever project completed while undertaking GA's 10-week Front End Development course.

This project is an attempt to modernise an acquaintance's already existing heavy metal music news website http://metaltalk.net/ . You could almost say it was my go at a very basic optimisation without my knowledge back then!

My main inspiration at how I wanted it to look was http://www.metalinjection.net/ 

#Features

This is a very basic HTML, CSS, JS application with no real back end functionality. The project description did not require anything else.

#Styling

I kept the styling and colours as true as possible to the original website brand but I added a carousel, social media links and a more user friendly structure.

I used Foundation as my CSS framework so I could easily and effortlessly make the website responsive.

#Challenges

The carousel had given me a little bit of a hard time, especially in mobile but I managed to figure it out with the help of Stack Overflow!

Another challenge was to try and keep true to the brand without adding my own opinions on how it should look but respect the vision of the original makers.
